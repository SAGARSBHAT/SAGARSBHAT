### Hi Developers! I am Sagar S Bhat👋

Software Developer with a strong interest in Systems Programming and AI Engineering.  
I enjoy understanding how software works at a fundamental level, from algorithms and operating systems to system design and intelligent applications.
My experience includes software development, integration, automation, and testing in Linux environments. I primarily work with C++, Python, and shell scripting to build reliable and maintainable solutions.
Currently focused on strengthening core computer science fundamentals, solving data structure and algorithm problems regularly, and building projects that combine systems thinking with applied AI.
